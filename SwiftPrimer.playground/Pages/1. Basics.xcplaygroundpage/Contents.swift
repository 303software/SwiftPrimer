//: ## Type System
//: Swift is a strongly typed language with strong type inference.  This means you don't always have to explictly declare your types, the compiler will infer it for you.
let string1 : String = "yes"
let string2 = "yes" //compiler infers this is a string
//: Types can be aliased for ease of use or conceptual clarity
typealias MeaningOfLife = Int
let answer : MeaningOfLife = 42

//: ## Mutability
//: Swift has two different variable declaration keywords depending on the intended mutability.  Try and play with these
let immutable = 33 //cannot be reassigned
var mutable = 42 //can be reassigned
//: Using var vs let will change the available methods on value types like collections
var mutableArray = [1, 2, 3]
mutableArray.append(4)
let immutableArray = [1, 2, 3] //no append() method

//: ## Control Flow
//: You can construct sequences on the fly.  x...y will create a sequence from x to y inclusive of both.  You can also use < or >.  These loops are equivalent
for i in 0...2 {
    print(i) // 0, 1, 2
}
for i in 0..<3 {
    print(i) // 0, 1, 2
}

//: Traditional array based 'for in' loops are also supported
let alphabet = ["A", "B", "C"]
for letter in alphabet {
    print(letter) //A, B, C
}
//: Or get weirder and enumerate with an index.  The (index, element) structure is a Tuple, we'll get to them later
for (index, element) in alphabet.enumerate() {
    print("\(index):\(element)") //"0:A", "1:B", "2:C"
}
