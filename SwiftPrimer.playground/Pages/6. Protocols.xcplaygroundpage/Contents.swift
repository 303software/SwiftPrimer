# **Protocols**

/*:
The takeaway from all of this (very contrived) silliness is that protocols allow us to clump different types together and treat them as similar based on their functionality, not their identity.  If you need to make 1000 birds of different types fly, you should just be able to tell them to fly().  Each bird type can implement it's own unique way of actually flying, but since they all know how to fly(), we can treat them as a single type.
