# Structs

A struct is a value type.  They cannot be subclassed, as structs have no notion of inheritance.  Beyond that and their pass-by-value semantics they behave similar to classes.  They can be put in arrays (unlike Obj-C), contain functions, adhere to protocols etc.
*/
struct ValueType {
    var msg: String
    var fruit: String
}
//:  Structs are generated with implicit initializers for all their variables.  Even though we haven't defined one for ValueType, we can use:
ValueType(msg: "Dad?", fruit: "Pear")
//: They have innate support for restricting their functions based on mutable / immutable stats.  This is done by marking mutating functions with the `mutating` keyword and utilizing let vs var semantics
struct PandaBear {
    var name: String
    mutating func nameSteve() {
        name = "Steve"
    }

# Value vs Reference Types
*/
var ref = ReferenceType(msg: "Dad?")

ref.msg == ref2.msg //true

var value = ValueType(msg: "Who?", fruit: "Lyche")
var value2 = value
value2.fruit = "Guava"
value.fruit == value2.fruit //false

//: This needs some improvement.  Short of it is that value types (structs) make superior models in many situations because you can be assured no other code is modifying the model at any time.  You can think of new struct references (like below) generating a copy of the struct instead of another reference to the same object like classes.  This leads to more reliable code.  This isn't exactly the case, but it's pretty close.  Swift actually implements Copy On Write semantics to reduce the overhead of working with structs.  In reality, the struct copy is only made when necessary, i.e. a mutation occurs
