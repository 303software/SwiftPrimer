# Swift Primer

This is intended as an interactive supplement to the [Swift Language Book](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/).  The intended audience has some programming experience but is a Swift beginner.

Make sure `Render Documentation` is checked in the file inspector to render the markdown comments.

Play around!  If you mess something up and the playground won't compile, you can always revert with `git checkout -- *`

## Contributing

Everything could use a least a little love, but some particular areas that need to be started or expounded on:

+ Extensions (general)
+ Protocol Extensions (specific)
+ Copy on Write semantics
+ Other control flow statements (do-repeat, repeat-while, etc)
+ Associated Types and generic protocols
+ Currying (expound and finish)
+ Objective-C interoperability
+ Access Control
